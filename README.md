# Supervised Learning Models: Implementation & Evaluation

This repository contains code and explanations for implementing common supervised machine learning models using Python. The focus is on regression and classification tasks, with detailed examples and comparisons of model performances.

## Features:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Implementation of regression models:
  - Linear Regression
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Implementation of classification models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Tree Classifier
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Naive Bayes
- Evaluation metrics:
  - Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE
  - Classification: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy
- Visualizations for metrics, residuals, and model comparisons

## Technologies Used:
- Python
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
